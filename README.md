# zero-test
The repo for integration test of [go-zero](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero) project.

## Why we create this repo?

For the past over two years of the development of go-zero project, we often have some scenarios that we cannot cover the cases with unit tests. So we decided to use integration test as well. Our goal is to improve the stability and keep the  API compatibility.
